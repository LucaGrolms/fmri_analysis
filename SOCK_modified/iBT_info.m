function [present, value] = iBT_info(infoFile, token, varargin)
% Read a value from a previously saved header info file or the like
%
% FORMAT [present, value] = iBT_info(infoFile, token, [type])
% where infoFile is the filename of the information file,
% 	token 	is the string preceding a colon for which to return the 
% 		value after the colon.
%	type	is an integer code indicating the return type as follows:
%		0 = string (default)
%		1 = number (via call to str2num() )
%
%	present is set to 1 if the token is found in the file, 0 otherwise
%
% Example: If a text file contains, amongst other things, 
%	   a line as follows:
%
% TR(s):3.2
%
% then [present, value] =  iBT_info(infoFile, 'TR(s)') 
% will return [1, '3.2']
% and [present, value] = iBT_info(infoFile, 'TR(s)', 1)
% will return [1, 3.2000]

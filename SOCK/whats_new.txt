Recent changes to SOCK
---------------------------------------------------------
2018-09-25 (v1.4d):
  (DFA)	Use fullfile rather than strcat for more reliable
  	path construction. Previously might have trouble
	finding mean.img if running SOCK from the GUI for
	an existing MELODIC ICA folder.

2018-04-11: 
  (DFA)	Acknowledge funding sources in Readme.txt

2017-11-28 (v1.4c):
  (DFA) Studylist files can now have # comments, quoted filenames,
        and auto-detected line-specific field count. Compatible with
	studylist files from iBrain Analysis Toolbox for SPM v3.6.

2017-05-26 (v1.4):
  (DFA) More robust to finding SPM's TPM.nii for use in segmentation.
  (DFA) Support studylist files from iBrain Analysis Toolbox for SPM,
        optionally with additional wildcardString Column.

2015-11-12 (v1.4beta):
  (DFA) Added support for SPM12.
  (DFA) Display component numbers in all classification categories 
	  (incl. previously undocumented "possible artifact" category)
  (DFA) New AGRESSIVE_ARTIFACT_CLASSIFICATION flag allows denoising
	  regression to include the "possible artifact" category
  (DFA) Put more effort into finding where SOCK is installed so 
	  less likely to need to edit this script.
  (DFA) Use diary command to log matlab session output to a file	

2015-06-19 (v1.3a):
  (DFA) batch_SOCK: Moved genpath line earlier so iBT_info.m can be found.
  (DFA) batch_SOCK: Display component numbers of identified artifacts to screen.
  
2015-06-16 (v1.3): 
  (DFA) New batch_SOCK function completely automates the application of SOCK as 
        a pre-processing noise filter.
  (DFA) SOCK now uses NIFTI_PAIR format internally, rather than ANALYZE.
  
2015-02-10 (v1.2): 
  (DFA) A change in the kmeans function in Matlab 2014a exercised a bug in
  	SOCK_measures/ps_measure_label.m that would cause a crash. There was a
	 missing transpose of sum_ps_matrix when passed to kmeans(). Prior
	 versions of Matlab gracefully dealt with this and still produced the
	 correct answer. Bug fixed in new SOCK version, lines 53 & 100 of
	 ps_measure_label.m: sum_ps_matrix is now sum_ps_matrix'
  (DFA) SOCK was writing temporary files to the SOCK distribution folder. Now
	SOCK creates a uniquely named temporary folder in the usual location for
	the operating system, and removes it upon completion.
  (DFA) SOCK now enters debug mode if an error occurs (dbstop instruction, 
  	line 38 of SOCK_main.m)
  (DFA) Switched to universal date format in version file 
  	(i.e. 2nd line was dd.mm.yyyy now yyyy-mm-dd).
		  		
2014-02-26 (v1.1):(KB) Changed the following code in fmristat/locmax.m at lines 256 & 261: 
		  Old code: rankrsl(iuclmrsl)=1:len;
			     ...
			     lm=[lm rankrsl(jclmid)' uclmvol(jclmid)' uclmrsl(jclmid)'];

		  New code: rankrsl(1,iuclmrsl)=1:len;
			     ...
                             lm=[lm rankrsl(1,jclmid)' uclmvol(1,jclmid)' uclmrsl(1,jclmid)'];

		  Changed the following code in SOCK_measures/smoothness_measure_func.m, lines 106-122:
 		  New code:
		  if mod(x,2) == 0
   			x_range = -floor(x/2)+1:floor(x/2);
  		  else
			x_range = -floor(x/2):floor(x/2);
   		  end

   		  if mod(y,2) == 0
   			y_range = -floor(y/2)+1:floor(y/2);
   		  else
			y_range = -floor(y/2):floor(y/2);
  		  end

   		  if mod(z,2) == 0
			z_range = -floor(z/2)+1:floor(z/2);
   		  else
			z_range = -floor(z/2):floor(z/2);
   		  end
   		  [X,Y,Z] = meshgrid(y_range,x_range,z_range);
   		  D = (X.^2)./(a^2) + (Y.^2)./(b^2) + (Z.^2)./(c^2);
			
2013-07-16 (v1.0): (DFA) Tidied up copyright notices and
		   licence information for the public 
		   release of SOCK version 1.0.
		   
2013-07-02 (pre-release): (KB) Added GNU Licence.
2013-06-24 (pre-release): (KB) Improved the documentation.
